Light intensity calculation


I = Energy * ( Radius^2 / ( Radius^2 + Mult * Dist^2 ) )

Energy [0,1]
Distance [0,inf)
Mult: (0,1]


We could add a linear component though...

I = Energy * ( Radius / ( Radius + LinearMult * Dist ) ) *
	( Radius^2 / (Radius^2 + QuadMult * Dist^2) )
	
	
Now.. Is it worth this more epensive calculation for having a linear component?
Not right now.


Overall though... we should allow mixing between linear and quadratic lights
But for now, were going to use a more simple... quadratic light falloff


What factors are there?

Well.. were going to use QuadMult of 1, so that only leaves us with 
Energy and Radius


This will map to brightness, and radius
