------------------------------------------- Future Improvments ------------------------------------------

* After 'FindActiveClusters' compute shader runs, possibly copy the active cluster buffer (or even just a variable 'activeBufferCount') back to CPU memory
* Then, when we dispatch 'Cull Lights' compute shader, we can dispatch one group for each active cluster, so we can skip on dispatching a large number of thread groups
	that we dont actually need, to speed up execution
* Find a method to increase the number of dynamic lights possible in a scene

* Move 'FindActiveClusters' step, into the g-buffer pass pixel shader again (although it seems to break shader debugging)
	- We could use a different graphics debugging tool to debug shaders
	- We could try a different resource type to write results into
	
- Re-write a lot of the renderer (in order of priority)
	* Shader system
	* Render loop
	* Seperate compute system?
	* Overall, cleanup

- Go from using 'NULL' to 'nullptr'
